<h2>Event</h2>
<p>Cut the Chi will take place on Friday, September 18, on the UC lawn at 4pm. There will be music and lawn games for your entertainment while winners make their haircuts. Winners should come prepared with payment for the winning bid and grand ideas for a wacky haircut.</p>

<h2>Bidding</h2>
<p>Bidding begins at $15 and must be a multiple of $5. Bid as much as you want, but remember your winning bid will need to be paid with cash or card during the Friday event. Professional stylists from local businesses will be on hand to help with the cutting, but a minimum $40 bid will be required to take the clippers in your own hands.</p>

<h2>Philanthropy</h2>

The proceeds from your bids will be used in support of this fantastic organization and the work they do. We encourage you learn more about the USO as you help us help them.</p>
